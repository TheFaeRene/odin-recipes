        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a fairly simple recipe, just a bit messy and<br> requires a bit of patience. If you don't mind a<br> bit of a mess, it can be fun for kids. It can also be used<br> for other fruit, frozen is more of a preference.</p> 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dark chocolate chips(60% or higher)</li>
            <li>Bananas</li>
            <li>Coconut Oil</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: sprinkles, nuts, flakey salt, shredded coconut</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice bananas into about half an inch thick pennies.<br>Thick enough to get a good bite but not too thick to bite through once frozen.</li>
            <li>Put chocolate chips and coconut oil in glass bowl and place over a pot of water on stove top<br> (Or melt in microwave but will have to keep reheating. 30 second intervals to keep from burning)</li>
            <li>Line cookie sheet with parchment paper</li>
            <li>Carefully stab banana slice with fork, dip in chocolate, turn to coat, let excess drip off and use<br> second fork to push banana slice off onto parchment lined sheet.<br> Make sure slices don't touch.</li>
            <li>Add toppings before chocolate sets.<br> Repeat until all slices are covered and pop into freezer.<br> Transfer into container once frozen soild.</li>
            <li>Can be left out <em>briefly</em> before eating to thaw slightly.</li>
        </ol>
